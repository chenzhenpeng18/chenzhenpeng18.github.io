            <p>I am a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with Prof. <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/">Yang Liu</a>. Additionally, I hold an Honorary Research Fellow position at University College London (UCL). Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at UCL, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Harman/">Mark Harman</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/F.Sarro/">Federica Sarro</a>. 

            <p> I received my Ph.D. from Peking University (PKU) in 2021, and was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b-ZYIwoAAAAJ&hl=en">Hong Mei</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.liuxuanzhe.com">Xuanzhe Liu</a>. My Ph.D dissertation won the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award of China Computer Federation. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from PKU in 2016.<br><br>My research interests mainly focus on Trustworthy AI, Software Engineering for AI, and AI for Software Engineering. I received WWW 2019 Best Full Paper Award, ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award (MSR 2023), ASE 2023 Distinguished PC Member Award, and Internetware 2024 Distinguished PC Member Award.</p>
